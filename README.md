# Game Time Tracker

A mindful gaming time tracker that helps you stay aware of your play habits without guilt or shame.

## Features

- **Session Timer** — Track current gaming sessions with persistent timing (continues even if you close the browser)
- **Daily/Weekly/Overall Stats** — See your gaming patterns at a glance
- **Evidence-Based Messaging** — Supportive prompts based on behavior change research, not guilt
- **Time Equivalents** — See what else you could do with the time (framed as opportunity, not shame)
- **Auto-Discard** — Sessions over 24 hours are automatically discarded (accidental tracking)
- **Mobile-Friendly** — Works well on phones and desktops

## Philosophy

This app is designed to **support self-control, not induce guilt**. Messages are:

- Autonomy-supportive ("You can..." not "You must...")
- Gain-framed (benefits of balance, not punishment for playing)
- Action-oriented (suggests concrete alternatives)
- Non-judgmental (acknowledges your choices)
